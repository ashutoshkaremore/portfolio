Recommendation Systems are everywhere. Be it Facebook feeds, Instagram reels, Amazon products, or Netflix moviesâ€”we see recommendations on almost every platform.<br>
A recommendation system in machine learning is an AI-powered tool designed to suggest relevant items (products, content, services, etc.) to users based on their past behavior, preferences, and interactions, as well as the behavior of similar users.
